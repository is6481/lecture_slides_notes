* **Section 1** -- Business Analytics Competency Center
    * BACC
        * Factors that limit successful creation and execution of business analytics
        * Lack of competencies in all parts of the business
        * Organizational structure prevents success
    * Includes the following competencies
        * Analytical
        * Business 
        * IT
    * What is it?
        * A problem solving forum
        * Maximize revenue flow from business analytics initiatives
        * Create analytics processes rather than IT processes
        * Ensures that business needs drive all technical initiatives
        * Ensures that the business relizes the benefits of BA 
        * Ensures the necessary analytics competencies are present and accessible
* **Section 2** -- Why set up a BACC?
    * Issues
        * Want BA function to have more of an impact
        * Analysts spread out in different departments
        * No common forum to discuss issues
        * Solutions only applicable locally in specific departments
    * How can it help?
        * A voice that can be heard throughout the organization
        * Two ways this can happen
            * Give the manager of the BACC formal influence on management forums
            * Create synergies at the functional level
        * Create an ongoing dialogue for the improvement of the business
        * Solutions can be shared across departments and functions
* **Section 3** -- Tasks and Competencies
    * The information wheel (see image below)
        * The Information Wheel describes the process of providing analytics to the business
        * Note that it is not always a cycle as shown, many projects finish with no follow up
        * Shows that the BACC lies at the center of what is provided
        * The BACC can be a dedicated team or can be decentralized (more on this later)
    * Create learning
        * The purpose of knowledge management is to have the best of both: a decentralized organization releasing its full creative potential while at the same time making sure that other decentralized units reuse the good ideas generated.
        * How do we do it?
	        * Public document store
	        * Internal Wiki
	        * Knowledge Management System
	        * Digital solutions may lead to person-to-person interactions (and improve the knowledge stored in digital form)
    * Technology benefits
        * Could reduce software costs via standardization and reduced duplication
        * A possible better negotiating position with vendors
        * Reduced number of technologies results in smaller need for expertise in different software packages
        * Reduces the number of projects needed to integrate different platforms
    * Additional notes regarding technology
        * The BACC does not design information architecture or technology strategies
        * The BACC enters into a dialogue with system owners to ensure the information architecture and technology strategies support the organization’s information strategy
        * The scope of the BA function should be dictated by the business, not by technological solutions
    * Educating users
        * The results of the information generation process will create some solution (often a report or dashboard). 
        * The following are true:
            * The solution is never better than its users
            * A successful implementation requires three elements
                * User friendliness
                * Relevant information
                * General support
    * User Friendliness
        * What
            * The system/report must be inviting, intuitive, and clear
        * How
            * Get feedback from users
            * Typically needed before and after delivery
            * Build in a period for feedback
    * Relevance of Information
        * What
            * Information must be available, accurate, and actionable
        * How
            * Requires a front-end system that can provide information at the speed necessary
            * Need to validate data both internally and externally
            * Right data to the right people at the right time in a way they can use it
    * General Support
        * What
            * Users should be trained, there should be a way to get answers to questions and submit feedback
        * How
            * Training sessions
            * Remote training sessions
            * Video content that can be referred to when needed (knowledge management system)
* **Section 4** -- Centralized or Decentralized Organization
	* Centralized
		* BACC set up as an organizational support unit
		* Generally reports directly to the strategic function of the business
	* Virtualized (cross-functional group)
		* BACC established as a virtual organization
		* Smaller strategic role
		* Primarily setup to function at an operational level
		* Should facilitate synergies at the departmental level
	* Should determine if goal is to support strategy or improve performance.
		* Performance focus means focusing on being proactive
	* Proactive vs reactive
		* Reactive
			* Processes setup to make requests of analysts
			* Users ”order” information/knowledge
			* Agreed upon deadlines
			* Not great for realtime or creative projects
			* Deadlines tend to be set in days or weeks
			* The business may use the BA function less and less over time
			* Reduces value of analytic team and reduces value of the data warehouse
		* Proactive
			* To be proactive, make sure analysts participate as a part of the team
			* This means analysts can advise on which data will deliver optimum results
			* Constitutes an ongoing briefing of the analyst with regard to what is important
			* Answers will be derived quicker
			* Answers will be relevant more often the first time
			* Requires a special kind of analyst
			* Additional notes
				* Means analysts must be included in the work teams that draw on their resources
				* A decentralized BACC is sufficient if a proactive operational group is desired
				* Ensured direct access to end-users
				* Are involved in the development of value-creating processes
	* If a closer integration with strategy is desired
		* If a closer integration with strategy is desired -> strong case for creating a formal organizational entity
		* Primary argument is that the BACC has a place on the executive team in the form of the manager/director of the analytics group
		* Director has the formal authority to prioritize strategic tasks
			* Allows BACC to detach from operational needs when necessary
			* Focuses IT resources on providing value instead of focusing on maintenance
		* Goal of BACC management to identify where the company is now and where it would like to be (reference to 4 scenarios from chapter 2)
	* Maturity assessment
		* Technical elements – do we possess the technology necessary to mature?
		* People elements – do we have the right competencies and resources?
		* Business process elements – are we organized in the right way to meet our objectives?
	* When analytics reports to IT dept
		* Turns the value chain upside down
		* Analysts report only what is available in the data warehouse
		* When analysts acts in a grey area where should their loyalty be placed?
		* Analyst’s role to challenge the data warehouse
* **Section 5** -- When to start BACC
	* Beginning of a data warehouse project
		* Analysts can contribute to the requirement gathering process
		* BACC can oversee the actual project so you don’t forget why it started to begin with
	* As a data warehouse project finishes
		* Can be used as a kick-off for the BACC to begin working together
		* Transfer knowledge as resources exit the project
		* Make sure we know why things were created in a certain way
		* Design reporting structures and processes in relation to use, maintenance, and future modifications
	* When strategic level wants to start using at as a resource (any time, really)
		* Ask the question: who will drive this further – leads to creation of Analytics group (BACC)
		* Often need to address soft issues
		* Train the organization on how to be data driven
		* Change attitudes
		* Help understand the importance of data quality
		* Management must support the effort
	* What happens if roll-out not done properly?
		* Get into a vicious cycle where system has no users and dies
		* Poor data quality will reduce effectiveness
		* Projects will fail if people are not trained properly
* **Section 6** -- Analytical Factories
	* Not a term you will hear very often
	* What is usually required when setting up new analytical processes?
		* Determine which messaging is necessary for objectives
		* Kick off a project to specify how the database will be used
		* Create new ETL processes
		* Investigate new data sets
		* Add campaign to marketing automation system
	* Analytical factory approach
		* Fixed set of data sets containing customer properties (incl behaviors)
		* Fixed process/format for specifying subgroups of customers
		* Fixed process/format for specifying messaging
		* Fixed QA process
		* Fixed deployment process
	* In an "analytical factory" the analytics group sets up a process for making changes or adding to a specific system. All processes are standardized such that analysts need not be included when planned modifications or additions are made.
