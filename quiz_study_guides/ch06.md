-   **Section 1** – Source Systems
    -   Source System
        -   Data sources on which a data warehouse is based
        -   Many times there are several data warehouses integrated in
            such a way that one data warehouse can serve as a source
            system for another
    -   Data generating system
        -   Systems that create data the first time
        -   Many are front-end operational systems
        -   Not in the data warehouse
    -   Examples
        -   Billing Systems
            -   Print bills to named customers
            -   Used for behavior-based segmentations
            -   Value-based segmentations
        -   Social media data
            -   Public and key influencer perception
            -   Text mining for sentiment analysis
            -   Track social media attention against sales
            -   Who has an impact on company perception
        -   CRM Systems
            -   Customer contact history (email, phone)
            -   Progress through sales cycle
            -   Support tickets (sometimes)
            -   Customer value analysis
            -   Sales funnel analysis
        -   Product consumption data
            -   Which products are used over time
            -   Product feature use
            -   Churn predictions (in some cases)
        -   HR Systems
            -   Optimization of the people side of the business
            -   Hiring and retention
            -   hours worked and timesheets
            -   Org structure
        -   Analytics information
            -   KPIs
                -   Used for monitoring purposes
                -   If saved and snapshotted correctly can be used for
                    optimization later on
            -   Data mining results
                -   Or other analytics projects
                -   Segmentations, sales models, loyalty segmentation
                -   Used to create learning about causal relations
                    across the business
-   **Section 2** – Best use of information
    -   Example of churn model – what data do we need?
        -   What data do we have available?
            -   Any of the dozens of data sets from our data-generating
                source systems
        -   Should we use that data?
            -   In general, we don’t know
            -   Make a list of data sets that should be used for the
                specific task at hand (build a Churn model/understand
                customer health)
    -   After the exercise of determining what might be relevant to the
        problem at hand, what’s next?
        -   Need to outline what data you have that is related.
        -   Many times if the exact data is not available, a suitable
            substitute can be derived from existing data
        -   Need to know how to get from point A to point B
            -   This is where a skilled analyst comes in handy
    -   Looking at data in terms of Availability and Usability
        -   Availability
            -   Data may not be stored in a system where it can be
                extracted
            -   The effort to extract the data may be too great
            -   There may be no key to join on (so the data can’t be
                combined with data from other systems)
            -   The data may not be collected at the right time
                intervals
            -   You may not be collecting the data at all
        -   Usability
            -   Data may not be relevant to the task at hand
    -   Availability and Usability can be adjusted by using the data
        warehouse
        -   Availability
            -   Data can be made more available by moving it into the
                data warehouse
        -   Usability
            -   Usability can be increased if the data is enriched with
                other business rules and history
            -   Usability can be decreased if the data is aggregated or
                if information is removed as it is moved into the data
                warehouse
            -   Usability can generally be increased if it is joined
                with data from other systems
-   **Section 3** – More than one way to tackle a problem
    -   External Analysts
        -   Typically work with questionnaires or focus groups
        -   Often leveraging external agencies that specialize in
            different analyses
            -   Internal staff then focus on making sure the project
                meets objectives
            -   And focus on communicating results
        -   Projects will generally take months to complete
        -   Can be quite expensive to run these projects but other data
            may not yield the same level of insight
    -   Internal Analysts
        -   Typically work with data stored in the data warehouse
        -   Will likely be part of an internal analytics team
        -   Projects range from weeks to months
        -   Relatively inexpensive since the data is generally stored in
            the data warehouse anyway
        -   Results can be implemented directly in the data warehouse
            when completed
    -   When would you use each?
        -   External Analysis
            -   To collect attitudes and feelings from customers (data
                that is generally not in a data warehouse)
            -   To test new scenarios or products
            -   Test new pricing schemes
            -   Can be used to determine what data to collect in the
                data warehouse
            -   May produce more accurate forecasts
        -   Internal Analysis
            -   To collect behavioral data (either through transactions
                or product tracking)
            -   Can be done relatively quickly
            -   Can produce interim results very quickly
            -   Can be implemented directly in the data warehouse
            -   Can be used to determine what to ask in questionnaire
            -   May produce more accurate forecasts
-   **Section 4** – Data Quality (again)
    -   Data quality consequences
        -   Contradictory reports
        -   Deviating from business plans (budgets)
        -   Leads to misguided decisions
        -   Reports can be dated, inconsistent, and incorrect
    -   Ensuring data is clean at the source
        -   Make fields required
        -   Enforce formatting on input
        -   Use drop down lists
        -   Limit raw input to comment fields
        -   Use wizards for object creation
        -   Limit entry of similar data into multiple systems
