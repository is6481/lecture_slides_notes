* **Introduction**
    * What can we expect an advanced analytical organization to be able to do?
    * Which methods can generate which types of decision support.
    * Create a basis for dialogue between the company and the analyst.
    * Make it possible for the company to formulate exactly what it wants from its BA function.
* **Data, Information, and Knowledge**
    * Data
        * Carrier of information
        * Too specific to be used for decision support
        * Not structured to make sense â€“ could make sense in many contexts
    * Information
        * Aggregated to a level where it makes sense
        * Includes reports, tables or lists
    * Knowledge
        * Information interpreted
        * If a table is used, it is delivered with a summary or presentation of that it means in relation to business objectives
        * Not a result of automation
        * Requires analysts, quantitative methods and business insight
