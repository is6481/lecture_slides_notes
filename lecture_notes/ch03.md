-   **Section 1** – Introduction
    -   Identify how to get from having some overall objectives for a
        department to specifying information and data requirements.
    -   We discuss the relationship between BA and the operational level
        and the relationship between strategic plans and how to
        operationalize them with a focus on the BA function’s
        deliveries.
    -    Just as we need to formulate a customer relationship management
        (CRM) strategy to reflect the overall strategy and its
        requirements to the CRM function, we also need to have an
        information strategy in place that reflects the information and
        data requirements placed by corporate strategy to the BA
        function.
    -   Corporate Strategy: Set of objectives to meet a particular
        business goal
    -   Information Strategy: set of data requirements to achieve the
        corporate strategy
    -   Lead
        -   Definition – “Something that comes before”
        -   Collection strategy – Knowledge necessary for getting a
            process started/improve existing
        -   Systems – Typically comes from ad hoc projects
    -   Lag
        -   Defintion – “Something that comes after”
        -   Collection Strategy – Continuous measuring of how the
            process is meeting objectives
        -   Systems – Conventionally automated reporting on key
            indicators
-   **Section 2** – Summerhouse Example
    -   Introduce some concepts
        -   KPIs
        -   Performance managment
        -   Information requirements
        -   Dashboards
    -   Analytics must answer the following questions
        -   Status – have we gone far enough in relation to how long
            we’ve been on the road
        -   Trend – are we accelerating up or down, or is our speed
            constant?
        -   Projection – given our speed and how far we’ve gone, will we
            reach the summerhouse at the expected time?
    -   KPIs
        -   KPIs describe the relationship between the organization and
            its main objectives
        -   Describe when the company is doing well and when it is off
            track
        -   The existence of KPIs along with their associated targets
            allows the business to adjust tactics (keeping strategy
            fixed)
        -   Provide the organization with a memory so learning can be
            derived from projects
    -   What can we learn when KPIs are not meeting their targets
        -   Lack of strategic focus
            -   KPI is not visible to relevant staff
            -   Visible but no one cares
            -   Strategy has shifted
            -   Mistrust in the data
        -   Lack of competency
            -   Business executing correctly but KPI is not reaching the
                desired level
            -   Need to research competencies necessary to perform task
                well and competencies present in the business
        -   Changing environment
            -   Are we operating under different conditions than when
                strategy developed?
            -   Were the targets set inappropriately?
