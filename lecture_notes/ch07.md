-   **Section 1** – Business Analytics Competency Center
    -   BACC
        -   Factors that limit successful creation and execution of
            business analytics
        -   Lack of competencies in all parts of the business
        -   Organizational structure prevents success
    -   Includes the following competencies
        -   Analytical
        -   Business
        -   IT
    -   What is it?
        -   A problem solving forum
        -   Maximize revenue flow from business analytics initiatives
        -   Create analytics processes rather than IT processes
        -   Ensures that business needs drive all technical initiatives
        -   Ensures that the business relizes the benefits of BA
        -   Ensures the necessary analytics competencies are present and
            accessible
-   **Section 2** – Why set up a BACC?
    -   Issues
        -   Want BA function to have more of an impact
        -   Analysts spread out in different departments
        -   No common forum to discuss issues
        -   Solutions only applicable locally in specific departments
    -   How can it help?
        -   A voice that can be heard throughout the organization
        -   Two ways this can happen
            -   Give the manager of the BACC formal influence on
                management forums
            -   Create synergies at the functional level
        -   Create an ongoing dialogue for the improvement of the
            business
        -   Solutions can be shared across departments and functions
-   **Section 3** – Tasks and Competencies
    -   The information wheel (see image below)
        -   The Information Wheel describes the process of providing
            analytics to the business
        -   Note that it is not always a cycle as shown, many projects
            finish with no follow up
        -   Shows that the BACC lies at the center of what is provided
        -   The BACC can be a dedicated team or can be decentralized
            (more on this later)
